## Abstract:
In this dissertation, I conducted a comparative analysis of several Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) and their application to the energy sector. This research aims to assess the scalability, energy efficiency, and regulatory compliance of PETs, especially in the context of GDPR. I explored technologies such as homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation (SMPC), and trusted execution environments (TEEs), evaluating their effectiveness in ensuring consumer privacy and improving data security.
